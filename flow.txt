        *******--->after every succful game or end of game or ANY GUESS: whenever user "click either play gain" or
         "go to dashboard" or "abort" or "our page flip after any guess" we have to 
                    check the revalute the coins:
                            ---> if win: add 100+ coins 
                            ---> if time ended: 20 points deducted
                            ---> at every flip: remaining amount show ( because backend calulate the rem)
                            OVERALL just show the updted coins after flip/ button click(abort/play again/ dahboard)
                            
                            why? because in the end we just show the prize on the card but didnt actually add it
                            so always check the varibale set by the server i.e congratulation/ correct guess/ wrong guess.
